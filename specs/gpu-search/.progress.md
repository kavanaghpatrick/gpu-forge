# Progress: gpu-search

## Original Goal

Build a GPU-accelerated filesystem search tool (gpu-search) as a standalone Rust project at gpu_kernel/gpu-search/. Reuse GPU backend from rust-experiment project -- port Metal compute search kernels (vectorized uchar4 matching, SIMD prefix sum, 55-80 GB/s), MTLIOCommandQueue batch file loading, GPU-resident filesystem index, streaming search pipeline, and persistent kernel batch variant to objc2-metal. CPU renders UI via egui/eframe floating panel (Spotlight-style, global hotkey). Both filename + content search from day one. Fixed string matching for MVP. Respects .gitignore by default. Full foreman spec analysis exists in ai/tasks/spec/ (PM.md, UX.md, TECH.md, QA.md, OVERVIEW.md) -- synthesize research/requirements/design/tasks from those 4 comprehensive artifacts (59 tasks across 7 modules). Key decisions: objc2-metal clean port, egui floating panel with dark Tokyo Night theme, triple-buffered work queue from gpu-query, completion-handler re-dispatch, MTLSharedEvent idle/wake, JIT PSO cache, syntect for syntax highlighting, virtual scroll for 10K results, Criterion benchmarks with ripgrep comparison. Search-as-you-type <5ms latency target.

## Current Phase
execution

## Reality Check (BEFORE)

**Goal type**: Add
**Classification**: New standalone project -- GPU-accelerated filesystem search tool
**No reproduction needed**: This is a greenfield build, not a fix.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Create project directory structure
- [x] 1.2 Create Cargo.toml with all dependencies
- [x] 1.3 Create build.rs for Metal shader compilation
- [x] 1.5 Create stub main.rs and lib.rs

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- Comprehensive foreman analysis already exists at `ai/tasks/spec/` with 4 specialized agent outputs (PM, UX, TECH, QA) totaling ~3,500 lines
- 7 BREAKDOWN files provide module-level task decomposition with ~59 tasks across devops, gpu-engine, search-core, ui, index, bench, integration
- PM.md is for gpu-query (autonomous query engine), NOT gpu-search -- used for pattern reference only
- UX.md recommends iced framework, but user decision overrides to egui/eframe -- respected user Q&A decisions
- TECH.md provides comprehensive API translation table (metal 0.33 -> objc2-metal 0.3) and dual-Metal architecture design
- QA.md estimates ~385 tests across 6 dimensions with GPU-CPU dual verification as core pattern
- Source port is ~8,000 lines from rust-experiment, with MSL shader algorithms UNCHANGED
- Key risk: objc2-metal MTLIOCommandQueue bindings may be incomplete -- msg_send! fallback documented
- gpu-query at gpu_kernel/gpu-query/ provides direct reference for objc2-metal patterns (device, pipeline, work_queue, executor, build.rs)
- rust-experiment source files confirmed at expected paths with expected line counts
- Port order matters: device -> types -> mmap (simplest) -> gpu_io (complex msg_send! replacement) -> batch -> content_search -> streaming
- Cargo.toml: objc2-metal 0.3.2, eframe 0.31.1, syntect 5.3.0 all resolve cleanly; 481 packages total; bench stubs needed for cargo check to pass
- Cache location changes from ~/.gpu_os/ (rust-experiment) to ~/.gpu-search/ (new tool)
- Synthesized 52 tasks across 5 phases from 7 BREAKDOWN files, consolidating overlapping tasks
- Phase 1 (POC) has 16 tasks focused on scaffold + GPU engine port + basic search pipeline
- Phase 2 (Feature Complete) has 23 tasks for UI, orchestrator, index, filters, error handling
- Phase 3 (Testing) has 7 tasks for GPU-CPU verification, edge cases, stress tests
- Phase 4 (Quality Gates) has 8 tasks for benchmarks, CI, regression detection
- Project scaffold at gpu_kernel/gpu-search/ with 5 module dirs (gpu, search, io, index, ui), shaders/, tests/, benches/
- build.rs compiles .metal -> .air -> .metallib; with no .metal files it creates a stub metallib so downstream code can always load the library

## Next
Task 1.6: Port gpu/device.rs -- Metal device initialization
