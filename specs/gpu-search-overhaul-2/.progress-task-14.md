# Progress: gpu-search-overhaul-2 (Task 14 / 3.1)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 3.1 Unit tests for StampedUpdate generation filtering - PENDING_COMMIT

## Learnings
- `PipelineProfile` derives `Default`, making it easy to construct `SearchResponse` in tests without specifying all profile fields
- Generation guard is strict equality (`!=`), not `<` or `is_stale()` -- future generations are also rejected, not just stale ones
- Test helper `filter_by_generation()` mimics `poll_updates()` logic in a pure function: filter by exact generation match, return inner `SearchUpdate`
- 7 tests cover: current accepted, stale discarded, future discarded, rapid advance (only latest survives), Complete guarded, mixed stale/current, u64::MAX boundary
