# Progress: gpu-search-overhaul-2 (Task 16 / 3.3)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 3.3 Unit tests for ContentGroup building and sorting - PENDING_COMMIT

## Learnings
- ContentGroup grouping logic (recompute_groups, sort_groups_by_count) lives on GpuSearchApp in app.rs but is testable as standalone free functions since it's pure data manipulation
- Tests added to results_list.rs tests module (where ContentGroup struct is defined) using standalone helper functions that mirror the app methods
- Test names must contain "group" (not "grp") to match the verify filter `cargo test -p gpu-search group`
- `crate::ui::path_utils` is the correct import path from within the results_list tests module (not `super::path_utils`)
- Rust's sort_by is stable, so equal-count groups preserve insertion order (tested in U-GRP-6)
- Incremental grouping via last_grouped_index is efficient -- only new matches are processed on each call
