# Progress: gpu-search-overhaul-2 (Task 18 / 3.5)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 3.5 Unit tests for adaptive VerifyMode - PENDING_COMMIT

## Learnings
- verify.rs already had `test_verify_mode_from_env` and `test_verify_mode_effective` covering basic scenarios; added 10 focused U-VFY tests for comprehensive coverage including boundary conditions (0, 99, 100, 101)
- All 23 verify tests pass (13 existing + 10 new)
