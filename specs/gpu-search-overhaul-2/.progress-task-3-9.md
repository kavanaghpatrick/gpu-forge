# Progress: gpu-search-overhaul-2 (Task 3.9)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 3.9 Unit tests for extension dot colors and status bar - PENDING_COMMIT

## Learnings
- Most U-DOT and U-SB tests already existed from tasks 2.2 and 2.7; only U-DOT-5 (case sensitivity) and U-SB-3 (root abbreviation) were new additions
- U-DEB-1 (100ms debounce default) already existed from task 1.3
- Case sensitivity test confirms extension_dot_color matches lowercase only per doc comment -- uppercase falls through to EXT_MUTED
- Root abbreviation test uses actual $HOME env var to verify ~ substitution flows through format_status()
- cargo test -p gpu-search doesn't support multiple test name filters in one command; must run separately per module
