# Progress: gpu-search-overhaul-2 (Task 19 - 3.6)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 3.6 Unit tests for match_range overlay - PENDING_COMMIT

## Learnings
- highlight.rs already had 25 tests (14 original + 11 from task 2.3) -- added 8 new U-MRO tests covering gaps
- Key gap was U-MRO-8: comparing apply_match_range_overlay (explicit range) vs apply_match_overlay (query string search) to verify both produce identical output
- U-MRO-5 tests exact span boundary alignment (match range exactly covers one span) -- verifies no extra splits
- U-MRO-6 tests empty ranges at various positions including inverted ranges (start > end) which the function handles via the `start >= end` guard
- colored_span helper useful for creating spans that simulate syntax highlighting colors for style-preservation assertions
- Pre-existing compilation error in results_list.rs (super::path_utils import) was already fixed in the working tree; cargo cached state just needed refresh

## Next
Task 3.7: Integration tests for stale result filtering
