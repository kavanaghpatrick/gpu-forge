# Progress: gpu-search-overhaul-2 (Task 3.8)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 3.8 Integration tests for navigation and row expansion - PENDING_COMMIT

## Learnings
- `build_groups_for_nav()` helper reuses the standalone `recompute_groups()` from U-GRP tests to create ContentGroup data for FlatRowModel tests
- Navigation tests (I-NAV-1 through I-NAV-7) verify header-skipping, wrap-around, Tab/Shift+Tab section jumping, empty results, and cross-section absence
- Expansion tests (I-EXP-1 through I-EXP-5) verify selected MatchRow gets 52px, unselected gets 24px, FileMatchRow always 24px, changing selection changes heights, and total height accounts for expansion
- All 12 integration tests pass alongside the existing 41 results_list tests (53 total)
