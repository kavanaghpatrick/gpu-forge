# Progress: gpu-compute-experiments

## Original Goal

Build a suite of 16 GPU compute benchmark experiments on Apple Silicon M4 Pro (273 GB/s, 20 GPU cores) to measure real-world speedups across key primitive categories: sort, scan, reduce, histogram, matmul, relational operations, and consumer app workloads. Each experiment compares GPU Metal vs CPU baseline. Results determine which layers of metal-forge-compute to prioritize.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Create workspace and forge-primitives crate skeleton
- [x] 1.2 Metal build.rs + reduce shader + types.h
- [x] 1.3 Create forge-bench crate with CLI, config, stats, data_gen

## Current Task

Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- Existing gpu-query shaders (filter.metal, compact.metal, aggregate.metal) are production-quality and reusable
- Inference pipeline achieved 462 tok/s decode on M4 Pro, validating Metal dispatch infrastructure
- Decoupled lookback and OneSweep DEADLOCK on Apple Silicon - use reduce-then-scan instead
- Single command buffer batching was key for inference perf (91→1 cmdbuf)
- Page-aligned buffers enable zero-copy via makeBuffer(bytesNoCopy:)
- Task planning: 52 tasks across 8 phases (POC, Foundation, Query Ops, Consumer, Run All, Testing, Quality, PR)
- Task planning: metal-forge-compute/ dir exists but only has an ai/ subdir -- all files are new creation
- Task planning: gpu-query/shaders/ has 11 .metal files with established patterns (aggregate.metal 3-level reduction, compact.metal atomic counter, filter.metal function constants)
- Task planning: build.rs pattern is identical across gpu-query and particle-system -- xcrun metal -c -> .air, xcrun metallib -> .metallib
- Task planning: Critical dependency chain: scan -> compact AND sort -> groupby -> pipeline. Must build scan first
- Task planning: Radix sort highest complexity (8 passes x 3 dispatches), sort experiment depends on scan kernels for histogram prefix sum
- Task planning: 65536-bin histogram may need tiling fallback if threadgroup memory > 32KB
- Task planning: No existing Cargo workspace at metal-forge-compute level -- must create from scratch
- Task planning: DuckDB experiment has CLI subprocess approach (not C API) -- simpler but ~50ms startup overhead

## Learnings (task 1.1)

- MTLDevice trait must be imported explicitly in pso_cache.rs for newComputePipelineStateWithFunction_error
- MetalContext library is Optional since no shaders compiled yet in task 1.1
- PsoCache simplified vs gpu-query: no function constants, just function name keyed

## Learnings (task 1.2)

- build.rs pattern copied directly from gpu-query/build.rs -- handles both stub (empty shaders dir) and real .metal files
- reduce.metal: 4 kernels (sum_u32, sum_f32, min_u32, max_u32) all use 3-level reduction: simd -> threadgroup shared mem -> global
- f32 sum uses CAS loop (atomic_compare_exchange_weak) since Metal has no atomic_float add
- min/max use per-threadgroup partials array (CPU does final reduction) since no atomic min/max on Metal
- types.h #include "types.h" works because build.rs passes -I shaders/ to xcrun metal

## Learnings (task 1.3)

- forge-bench skeleton already existed with stub Cargo.toml and main.rs from task 1.1
- clap 4 derive works cleanly for ForgeArgs: positional experiments + --sizes/--runs/--warmup/--profile/--json-file/--csv-file
- IQR outlier detection in stats.rs: filter values outside [Q1-1.5*IQR, Q3+1.5*IQR] before computing final stats
- DataGenerator uses StdRng::seed_from_u64 for deterministic benchmark data generation

## Blockers

- None currently

## Next

Task 1.4: Experiment trait + reduce experiment + CPU baseline
