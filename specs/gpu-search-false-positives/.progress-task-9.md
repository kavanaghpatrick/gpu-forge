# Progress: gpu-search-false-positives (Task 3.1)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 3.1 Add match_range accuracy tests

## Learnings
- SearchOrchestrator::search() blocking path creates SearchRequest with root dir, walks files, dispatches GPU, and resolves matches via resolve_match() which populates match_range as match_col..match_col+pattern.len()
- ContentMatch from types.rs has match_range: Range<usize> which is the byte range within line_content where the pattern was found
- GPU successfully detects matches near 64-byte thread boundaries (cols 58, 62, 63 all found correctly)
- GPU may find fewer matches than CPU (boundary misses) but all found matches have correct match_range
- PsoCache from gpu::pipeline needs a different import alias when used alongside the one from test helpers (used PsoCacheOrch)
- validate_match_ranges helper checks: range bounds, range length == pattern length, slice content matches pattern, CPU ground truth verification
- All 5 test cases pass: single match per file (5/5 found), multiple matches (4/4), start of line (4/5), end of line (1/5), thread boundary (3/3)
