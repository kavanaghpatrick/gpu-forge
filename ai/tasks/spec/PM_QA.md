# PM Q&A Decisions

1. **Hardware target**: M4-only (current machine)
2. **metal-flash-attention**: Write from scratch to learn internals, use MFA as reference for validation
3. **Burn/CubeCL priority**: Keep — architecturally important for build-vs-buy decision
4. **Finding granularity**: Fine-grained (40-60 findings, better KB searchability)
